# ⚡ Pulstack – Instant Static Site Deployment with Pulumi

`pulstack` is a developer-friendly tool that lets you deploy static websites to AWS (S3 + CloudFront) or GitHub Pages with zero configuraton. It uses [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/) under the hood to treat infrastructure as code, so your deployments are fully automated and version-controlled.

## 🧑‍💻 Who Is This For?

Pulstack is perfect if you:

- Have a static website (HTML/CSS/JS or React/Vite/Next.js build)
- Want to deploy to AWS (S3+CloudFront) or GitHub Pages in 1 command
- Don’t want to write YAML, CloudFormation, or Terraform
- Like simple CLI workflows with guided and simple prompts


## ✨ Features

- 🚀 Deploy static sites to AWS S3 with CloudFront CDN

- 🌍 Automatically create Repo and publish to GitHub Pages

- 🔒 Secure AWS deployments using best practices (no public buckets!)

- 💡 Clean CLI prompts to guide you through setup

- 🧨 One-command destroy of your whole stack when you're done

## 📦 Prerequisites
You only need to install the tools for the provider you want to use (AWS or GitHub). Here's a breakdown:

### 🔧 Required for All
#### 1.  Node.js
   ```bash
   node -v
   ```
#### 2. Pulumi
Install it from [https://www.pulumi.com/docs/install/](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/install/)

```bash
pulumi version
pulumi login
```
> [!IMPORTANT]
> You'll need to log in to Pulumi (Mandatory)

### 🌩️ If You Want to Deploy to AWS (S3 + CloudFront)


#### ✅ Install AWS CLI
(for S3/CloudFront deployments only, You can skip this if you want to deploy on GitHub)

```bash
aws --version
```

If not installed: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html


**Create IAM user in aws console with necessary permissions**
- `s3:*` – Create and manage buckets, upload files, set bucket policies.
- `cloudfront:*` – Create and configure CloudFront distributions.
- `iam:GetUser, iam:PassRole` – Required for linking CloudFront with S3 via OAI.
- `iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole` – Needed for enabling AWS services like CloudFront.
- `logs:*` – For any logging resources created by Pulumi or AWS services.
- `sts:GetCallerIdentity` – Used by Pulumi to identify the active IAM user.


**🔐 Configure AWS Credentials**
```bash
aws configure
```


**You'll need:**
- AWS Access Key ID
- AWS Secret Access Key
- Default region (e.g., us-east-1)


**Ensure credentials are valid:**
```bash
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure the IAM user has the necessary permissions.

### 🐙 If You Want to Deploy to GitHub Pages

#### 🔐 Create GitHub Token
(for GitHub Pages only, You can skip this if you want to deploy on AWS S3)

- Create a Personal Access Token(Classic) with `repo` and `delete_repo` permission enabled.

- Save this somewhere safe — you’ll need it during `init`.
